# AQUAPONICS Mobile Application

The aquaponics application possesses the ability to monitor and regulate various environmental parameters, including dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, turbidity, water level, and ammonia levels. This functionality is accessible through both online and offline applications, enabling users to conveniently receive system notifications on a cloud-based platform. Furthermore, the system will facilitate the management and regulation of fish feeds based on predetermined schedules and the specified quantity of feeds in an automated manner. The utilization of water quality sensors and actuators in aquaponics systems enables the regulation and maintenance of optimal water quality parameters. This ensures the provision of favorable conditions for both fish and plants, hence reducing the need for excessive human intervention.
